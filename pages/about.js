          description1='ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Navid. Iâ€™m currently studying Digital Design and Development at BCIT. I have a strong passion for graphic design and web development with a great interest in the field of UI/UX. Iâ€™ve developed experience in asset creation, layout design and development, and user experience research and design. I am proficient in using Adobe Creative Cloud and Figma for graphic design and UI/UX. I am also proficient in using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript and have developed a variety of responsive web pages.' 
          description2='I love design, and exploring different methods and styles to create something pleasing to the eyes. I enjoy solving problems creatively and efficiently using modern solutions. I love to stay updated on the latest tech releases and innovations in the design industry. Iâ€™m adaptive and detail-oriented, and I often find myself to be an extrovert thinker in a team environment as I love bouncing around ideas and compromising to come up with the best solution.' 
          description3='In my spare time I often like to ðŸ’ªworkout at the gym, ðŸ“–read manga and ðŸŽ®play video games. When I find the right motivation I love to develop my skills in other software and programming languages. This year I have been learning game development using the Godot engine and C#. My favourite genre of media is horror as I find that itâ€™s very hard to make successfully, and I have tremendous respect for authors and directors that do make enjoyable horror media.'
